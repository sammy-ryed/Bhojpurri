# ⚡ Quick Reference - After Cleanup

## ✅ What Was Removed

| Item | Why Removed |
|------|-------------|
| ❌ Placeholder "Hello, how are you today?" | Was fake - better to fail honestly |
| ❌ Google TTS fallback | Was unreliable, MP3 codec issues |

## 🎯 Current App Status

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Recording         ✅ WORKS                  │
│ Transcription     ❌ NEEDS STT API          │
│ Translation       ✅ WORKS (OpenL)          │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 Run Command

```powershell
mvn exec:java "-Dexec.classpathScope=runtime"
```

## 📝 What Happens Now

1. Press SPACE → ✅ Records voice
2. Release SPACE → ✅ Saves WAV file
3. Transcribe → ❌ **ERROR: "Speech-to-Text requires a dedicated STT API"**
