# üîç Voice Recording & Transcription Issues - Diagnostic Report

## Date: October 16, 2025
## Status: ‚úÖ UPDATED - Placeholder & Fallback Removed

## Summary

‚úÖ **Recording**: WORKING (391,428 bytes captured successfully)  
‚ùå **Transcription**: NOW FAILS WITH CLEAR ERROR (placeholder removed)  
‚úÖ **Translation**: WORKING (English ‚Üí Bhojpuri)  
‚ùå **Text-to-Speech**: SPEECHIFY ONLY (Google fallback removed)  

---

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Removed Placeholder Transcription
- **Before**: Always returned "Hello, how are you today?" 
- **After**: Throws `UnsupportedOperationException` with clear message
- **Result**: App now fails honestly instead of using fake data

### 2. Removed Google TTS Fallback
- **Before**: Fell back to unreliable Google TTS when Speechify failed
- **After**: Uses Speechify API only, fails if endpoints don't work
- **Result**: Cleaner code, honest error messages

---

## Current Application State

When you run the app now:

1. **Press SPACE** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Recording starts
2. **Speak** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Voice captured to WAV file  
3. **Release SPACE** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Recording saved
4. **Transcription** ‚Üí ‚ùå **FAILS** with error:
   ```
   UnsupportedOperationException: Speech-to-Text requires a dedicated 
   STT API (OpenAI Whisper, Google STT, or Azure Speech)
   ```

This is **intentional and better** than silently using fake placeholder data!

---

## Testing Your Recording

To verify your microphone is working, manually play the recorded file:

```powershell
# Find the latest recording
dir "audio_recordings" | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1

# Play it (Windows)
start "audio_recordings\recording_1760634750732.wav"
```

**Expected**: You should hear your own voice clearly.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix MP3 Playback (Quick Fix) ‚úÖ

Run the app with the correct classpath:
```powershell
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java "-Dexec.classpathScope=runtime"
```

### Solution 2: Add Real Speech-to-Text (Requires API Key) üí∞

You need to integrate with a paid STT service. Options:

#### Option A: OpenAI Whisper API (Recommended)
- **Cost**: $0.006 per minute
- **Accuracy**: Excellent
- **Languages**: 97+ languages including regional dialects

#### Option B: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
- **Cost**: $0.006-$0.016 per 15 seconds
- **Accuracy**: Very good
- **Free tier**: 60 minutes/month

#### Option C: Azure Speech Services  
- **Cost**: $1 per hour
- **Accuracy**: Very good  
- **Free tier**: 5 hours/month

### Solution 3: Test with Placeholder (Current State)

The app currently works like this:
1. ‚úÖ Records your voice
2. ‚ùå Ignores recording, uses "Hello, how are you today?"
3. ‚úÖ Translates placeholder to Bhojpuri
4. ‚ùå Cannot play TTS audio (MP3 codec issue)

## What Actually Works

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Microphone Recording | ‚úÖ Working | 391,428 bytes WAV file |
| Audio Format | ‚úÖ Correct | 44.1kHz, 16-bit, Mono |
| File Saving | ‚úÖ Working | `audio_recordings/recording_xxx.wav` |
| Transcription | ‚ùå Placeholder Only | Always returns "Hello, how are you today?" |
| Translation API | ‚úÖ Working | "Hello" ‚Üí "‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á" |
| TTS Download | ‚úÖ Working | 21,120 bytes MP3 downloaded |
| MP3 Playback | ‚ùå Codec Missing | `UnsupportedAudioFileException` |

---

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Fix MP3 playback** (Run with `-Dexec.classpathScope=runtime`)
2. **Test your recording** (Play the WAV file manually to confirm mic works)
3. **Decide on STT provider** (Choose OpenAI, Google, or Azure)
4. **Get API key** for chosen STT service
5. **Implement STT integration** in `Translator.java`

---

## Quick Test Command

```powershell
# Close current app window first, then run:
mvn exec:java "-Dexec.classpathScope=runtime"
```

This will fix the MP3 playback issue. The transcription will still use placeholder text until you integrate a real STT API.
