## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong:

### "Groq API key not configured"
→ You forgot to add your API key to line 24 of Translator.java

### "401 Unauthorized"
→ API key is wrong or inactive - check it at https://console.groq.com/

### "File too large"
→ Recording is too long - speak shorter sentences

### No transcription / blank text
→ Speak louder and clearer into the microphone

2. **Add to code** (line 24)
